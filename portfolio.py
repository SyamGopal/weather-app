    - **Role:** Developer
    - **Team Size:** 2
    - **Project Duration:** 1 Month
    - **Technologies Used:** Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV
    - **Description:** Developed a machine learning model to detect diseases in mango leaves. The project involved:
        - Collecting and preprocessing a dataset of healthy and diseased mango leaves.
        - Using image processing techniques with OpenCV to enhance the images.
        - Building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify the leaves as healthy or diseased.
        - Achieving a high accuracy rate in detecting different types of leaf diseases.
        - Deploying the model using a simple web interface for ease of use by farmers and agricultural experts.
